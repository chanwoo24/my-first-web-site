        <p><h2>A capitalist society is a free society.</h2> 
            The recipe for success in a free society is a combination of hard work, intelligence, empathy and a big serving of luck. In non-free societies the only requirement is political clout.</p>

        <p>Empathy helps you figure out what others need and value. Depending on what motivates you, your intelligence and hard work creates wealth that you exchange for what others produce in free markets.</p>

        <p>It is easy to define a free society but really hard to achieve because in every society there are enemies of freedom. They resist the creation of a free society. To the extent that the enemies of freedom win, society loses.</p>
