        <p>By satisfying other people.</p>

        <p><strong>In a <u>capitalist society</u>,</strong> all trade is voluntary. That means when you trade your coconut for 2 bananas, the bananas are worth more to you than the coconut, and the coconut is worth more to the person you are trading with than the bananas, otherwise the trade would not have happened.</p>

        <p>Those who acquire the most wealth in a capitalist society are those who provide the most value for the most people.</p>

        <p>Now, this is not an indictment on the poor. For a start, there are numerous regulation that prevent them from engaging in these voluntary exchanges. But, even without said regulation, people have variable skills due to factors that are not completely within peopleâ€™s control, and you end up with a Pareto distribution.</p>

        <p>People also value things differently. For example, some people have higher rates of time preference and thus they will prefer an income rather than investing in capital.</p>

        <p>People have different skills and also different interests. All people need to do is find a supply for their demand. Even if someone is more skilled than you at something, you could have a comparative advantage because they are even more skilled at something else.</p>

        <p>In a non-capitalist society, if you are silver-tongued then you could just rob people via the political means. Otherwise you are the one who is robbed.</p>
